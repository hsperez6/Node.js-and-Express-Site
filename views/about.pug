          p Financial Data Analyst – processed and wrangled financial data with R to create predictive models with statistically significant cross-validated accuracy, and discovered insights in raw data to drive business decisions based on evidence. 
          p Operations Manager – trained, scheduled and coordinated a teams in daily operations, kept track of inventory and handled supply chain logistics, and managed product and labor costs to deliver target metrics to achieve business goals.
